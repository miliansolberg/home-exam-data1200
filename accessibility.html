        <h2>Acessibility Testing</h2>

        <h3>What is the purpose of the accesibility test?</h3>
        <p>
          To ensure website accessibility for all individuals regardless of
          abilities or disabilities, we have utilized automated testing to gain
          insights and will discuss additional steps taken to achieve universal
          design enhancing the overall user experience.
        </p>

        <h3>Automated testing for Accesibility</h3>
        <p>
          The automated accesiblity test was performed using WAVE Evaluation
          Tool (https://wave.webaim.org/).
        </p>

        <p>
          WAVEÂ® is a suite of evaluation tools that helps authors make their web
          content more accessible to individuals with disabilities. WAVE can
          identify many accessibility and Web Content Accessibility Guideline
          (WCAG) errors, but also facilitates human evaluation of web content.
        </p>

        <h3>Testing process</h3>
        <p>
          We initiated the testing process by running the automated tool across
          all pages of our website. The tool provded us with a detailed report
          highlighting potential problem areas in our website. Here are a few
          screenshots below:

        <h3>Universal coding</h3>
        <p>
          While the automated test offered much valued insights, we recognize
          that manual testing is still necessary to ensure a universal design.
          Here are some coding choices we made to enhance the website's
          accesibility.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li id="smallBreak">
            <b>Semantic HTML: </b>We ensured that our HTML adhered to semantic
            standards, using appropriate tags for headings, lists, and other
            structural elements. This not only improves accessibility for screen
            readers but also enhances the overall clarity of our code.
          </li>
          <li id="smallBreak">
            <b>Responsive design: </b>Universal design extends to various
            devices and screen sizes. We implemented a responsive design
            approach, ensuring that our website adapts gracefully to different
            viewport sizes, benefiting users on both desktop and mobile devices.
          </li>
          <li id="smallBreak">
            <b>Color Contrast: </b>Color contrast is crucial for accessibility
            as it ensures that text and visual elements stand out distinctly,
            benefiting users with visual impairments or color blindness. A
            sufficient contrast ratio between foreground and background enhances
            readability and comprehension, making digital content accessible to
            a broader audience and aligning with inclusive design principles.
          </li>
          <li id="smallBreak">
            <b>Readable text: </b>Readable text is essential for accessibility
            as it ensures that information is easily comprehensible by users
            including those with visual impairments or cognitive challenges.
            Clear and legible text, with appropriate font styles and sizes,
            enables individuals using screen readers or magnification tools to
            access content effectively, fostering an inclusive digital
            experience for all users.
