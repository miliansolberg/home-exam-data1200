        <h2>Accessibility Testing</h2>

        <h3>What is the purpose of the accessibility test?</h3>
        <p>
          To ensure website accessibility for all individuals regardless of
          abilities or disabilities, we have utilized automated testing to gain
          insights and will discuss additional steps taken to achieve universal
          design enhancing the overall user experience.
        </p>

        <h3>Automated testing for accessibility</h3>
        <p>
          The automated accessibility test was performed using WAVE Evaluation
          Tool (https://wave.webaim.org/).
        </p>

        <p>
          WAVEÂ® is a suite of evaluation tools that helps authors make their web
          content more accessible to individuals with disabilities. WAVE can
          identify many accessibility and Web Content Accessibility Guideline
          (WCAG) errors, but also facilitates human evaluation of web content.
        </p>

        <h3>Testing process</h3>
        <p>
          We initiated the testing process by running the automated tool across
          all pages of our website. The tool provded us with a detailed report
          highlighting potential problem areas in our website. Here are a few
          screenshots below:

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>
          You will notice that there are some problems that appear across all
          pages. WAVE allows us to see what those problems are by simply
          clicking the "details" tab right next to summary.
        </p>

          Our main error had to do with form labels. The first error displays "A
          form control does not have a corresponding label." and the second
          displays "A form label is present, but does not contain any content."
        </p>
        <p>How we came to fix this is by...</p>
        <p>
          Another thing you may notice is that the logo seems to be crashing
          with our header on the top. However this seems to be a problem that
          only appears when using the WAVE evaluation tool as it doesn't seem to
          mention the logo and the header crashing as a problem. Our website is
          also responsive and has been tested with different dimensions using
          inspect element and it doesn't appear to have that problem:

        <p>We also changed the logo in the end, so it doesn't really matter in the end.</p>

        <p>Lastly, our website has 2 alerts about redundant link which displays "Adjacent links go to the same URL.
          ". What it basically means is that our header links to the same page as the "Home" button in the navigation bar. This is a simple fix, which is simply remove the hyperlink to our homepage from the header.</p>

        <h3>Further accessibility testing</h3>
        <p>
          While the automated test offered much valued insights, we recognize
          that manual testing is still necessary to ensure a universal design.
          Here are some coding choices we made to enhance the website's
          accessibility.
        </p>
        <ul class="bulletpoint">
          <li id="smallBreak">
            <b>Semantic HTML: </b>We ensured that our HTML adhered to semantic
            standards, using appropriate tags for headings, lists, and other
            structural elements. This not only improves accessibility for screen
            readers but also enhances the overall clarity of our code.
          </li>
          <li id="smallBreak">
            <b>Responsive design: </b>Universal design extends to various
            devices and screen sizes. We implemented a responsive design
            approach, ensuring that our website adapts to different
            viewport sizes, benefiting users on both desktop and mobile devices. This can be seen <a class="links" href="#viewportLink">further up in the page.</a>
          </li>
          <li id="smallBreak">
            <b>Color Contrast: </b>Color contrast is crucial for accessibility
            as it ensures that text and visual elements stand out distinctly,
            benefiting users with visual impairments or color blindness. Our website has good color contrast as we mainly have blacks and whites.
          </li>
          <li id="smallBreak">
            <b>Readable text: </b>Our website uses a legible font which are easy to read. Readable text is essential for accessibility
            as it ensures that information is easily comprehensible by users
            including those with visual impairments or cognitive challenges.
